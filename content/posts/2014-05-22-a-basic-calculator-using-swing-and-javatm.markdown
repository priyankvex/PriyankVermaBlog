Java simple calculator

1. A four-function calculator with the following functions:
* Addition – adds two numbers
* Subtraction – subtracts number two from number one
* Multiplication – Multiplies two numbers
* Division – divides number two into number one

2. Used JButton for the numbers and functions.

3. Created a class to respond to the events caused by numbers, functions, exit, help and about functionality.

The run-able .jar file can be downloaded freely from the link.
