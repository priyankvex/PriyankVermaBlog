Here is it end of week 2 of 11.133x. And we are back with the  sum up.

This week was about many aspects that one should deal with while implementing an education technology, like deciding education technology framework, how to analyse a ed tech, technology buying process etc.

This week started with **TPACK**. **What is TPACK and why does it matter?**

TPACK is a framework which combines 3 knowledge. These are technological knowledge, content knowledge and pedagogical knowledge.

**Content knowledge : **

It is the focus on the content that we have to teach and deliver to the students.

**Pedagogical Knowledge : **

How to teach that content? What methods are we going to use to deliver that content to the students. For example using group discussions, debates etc.

**Technological Knowledge  :**

Decide what kind of technology support is required to achieve this. It can be a case that technology is **not ** the best solution. This aspect should be analysed very carefully.

Next was a video on logistical and instructional half of an ed tech.

**Logistical and Instructional half to decide the use of ed tech : **

**1. Logistical half : **



	  1. Cost of that ed tech and funding available to implement that ed tech.
	  2. Access of the ed tech to students and teachers.
	  3. It should be equal for all. For example all must be using same tablet.
	  4. Usability of the ed tech. How easy is to use the ed tech.
	  5. Best ed tech is the one that students already know how to use.
	  6. Flexibility. Multi-use of the ed tech is possible or not.

A great example on flexibility of ed tech is popcorn machine and chefs knife. Though popcorn machine is very good at making popcorn, but it can't be used for other purposes. On the other hand chef's knife takes some time to learn, but can be used in many ways.

**2. Instructional Half : **



	  1. Quality of learning. How effective that ed tech is in improving the quality of learning. How much does it help to deliver complex topics to students.
	  2. Efficiency. How fast can students pick up the concepts by the use of the ed tech.
	  3. Possibilities of creation of new opportunities.
	  4. Collateral skill development.



Next in the course was a video on initiative on BYOD (Bring your on device) and and 1:1 student to device ratio in Maine.

In India, this can be possible by giving tablets, as Indian schools run on a tight budget. But 1:1 ratio is where the power lies.

Cloud based ed tech apps also have a great future and applications. Users can access all the information just using a website.

Each week brings new mind opening concepts regarding ed tech implementation. I am myself having some ideas on creating a ed tech. Will also look to connect to some open source ed tech organizations.

Let's see what is in store in next week.
