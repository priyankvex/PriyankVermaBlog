Marketing is no longer about the stuff that you make, but about the stories that you tell.

In today's world everyone in some way or another is trying to market themselves to the world. This becomes even more prominent if you are trying to attract customers to earn your living.

_Preping _to become an entrepreneur, I decided to take this course to get the proper understanding of how the mind of a marketer works.

This course included loads of case studies in the form of stories that covered many famous marketing campaigns world wide, from Viagra vs Cialis to Hershey's vs Mars. Each story will teach you important aspects and tactics of marketing. It will equip you will all the marketing jargon that you will no longer hesitate to invite your marketing friends for a cup of coffee or beer.

The course was 6 modules long. I did it in 15 days as I was running short on time.

**Module 1 : Changing nature of marketing, Competition**

It covered various tools and frameworks like 3C's , SWOT and PEST to understand the changing marketing scenario around your business.

Study of demographics and psycho-graphics to determine the target customers is another vital component.
