Here are the 9 things I would love to incorporate into my life as I set myself to see the sun of 2018.

**1. Stop chasing the long dream, start conquering the micro-goals:**
Start cultivating a passionate dedication to the pursuit of short-term goals, being micro ambitious.
Putting my head down and work with pride, whatever is the job in the hand.
If we see too far in front of us, we won't see shiny thing right in front of us.
Develop the habit of doing small things the great way.

**2. Stop waiting for being ready:**
Stop waiting for the moments of the future to be ready or to define oneself.
People, places, our choices all have already shaped us into who we are today.
These moments have already happened, and they will happen again.
You won't be ready, untill you start.

**3. Excercise :**
Run, play a sport, do yoga or whatever. Take care of my body. I am certainly going to need it.

**4. Be a teacher, share what I know:**
Don't take for granted what you know. Rejoice in what you learn and spray it.

**5. Read, read and read more:**
I am always going to be on the dumber end of the spectrum. Read as much as you can to cross the chasm to get to less dumber side.

**6. Constantly work on the weaknesses:**
Each day, every day, keep hitting the weaknesses by yourself.
Hopefully, they wont suck that much when the year ends.

**7. Remeber it's all luck, have gratitude:**
Understand truely that you cant take all the credit for your success, nor we can blame others for their failures.
Be more humble and more compassioante.
Emptahy is intuitive but it's also something that we can work on intellectually.

**8. Define myself from what I love:**
Not by what I hate. If someone asks us what music we like, we go "I hate EDM", what food you like, "I hate Chinese". From this year, I'll try to define my choices because of why I love them, not why I hate the others.
Be demonstrative and generous in the praise for those you admire.
Be pro-stuff, not just anti-stuff.

**9. Don't rush:**
You don't have to know what you are going to do for the rest of your life. Don't panic. Let the river inside you flow at its own pace.



PS: Note to self

Life is long, tough and tiring. You'll sometimes be happy and sometimes be sad, and then we die to get submerged into nothingness. There is only one way to make the best of our empty existence. Fill it.
Learn as much as you can. Take pride in what you do. Have compassion.  Share ideas. Demonstrate what you love.

Happy new year!
