<blockquote>People Respond to Effort</blockquote>


Lately I have been following Gary Vaynerchuck, an entrepreneur and serial investor. He also owns a social media marketing company _Vayner Media_. Listening to his podcasts and keynotes is an eye opener on how digital media marketing is reshaping the advertising world.

So I took a course on Edx Digital Branding and Engagement finally know the digital marketing in and out.

The course was 4 weeks long and delivers perfect contextual content.

**Module 1 : **

First module covered various topics like :



	  * Paid , Earned and Owned media.
	  * Consumer controlled market.
	  * Top consumer trends.
	  * Brand Advocacy.
	  * Audience multiplicity.

This module was enough to make you super excited about this field. It was full of content that you can relate to, you witness everyday on facebook, twitter etc, just naming it formally.

**Module 2 : **

This module was about **_Content Marketing. _**__That means examining content marketing, determining its value, content distribution strategies etc.

It showed many successful campaigns on social media as case study and its impact on company sales and publicity.



	  * Content marketing strategy.
	  * Branded content distribution.
	  * Content publishing.
	  * Investing in marketing.
	  * Distribution amplification.

As Gary Vee always say _**"Content is the king, but context is the queen"**_.

**Module 3 : **

This module was on _**Owned Media Assets.**_



	  * Owned media decision making.
	  * Websites, Landing pages, Microsites etc.
	  * SEO strategies.
	  * Branded Application for mobile.
	  * Gamification and Adver Games.

**Module 4 : **

Most vital component of digital marketing is _**Earned Media. **_That means all the brand advocates, customer relations you create via marketing and delivering value.



	  * Bottom up marketing.
	  * Earned media amplification.
	  * Social techno-graphic ladder.
	  * Participation branding.
	  * Crowed sourcing.
	  * Shaping earned media.

Soon I will start working on my product based start-up that is in stealth mode right now, what _**I think**_ would be a new way to _**consume content**_.




In this start-up bubble age when every one is looking to start their own company, marketing and reaching your consumer is the key. And best platform for marketing is _**FREE!!!. **_




I am very sure that all this gold mine of marketing knowledge will help.
