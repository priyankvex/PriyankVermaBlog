Hi there.
This post is to share my experience and work under getting started with '_Responsive web design_'.
I created a website under the theme of **House Of Horrors**, and I am not even leaving my desk and posting this right away.
Any suggestions are more then welcome!.As it was a project under '_Responsive Web design'_, so firstly what i did was, i created 3 wire frames of the website as **high resolution**, **medium resolution** and **low resolution**.High resolution layout will target the devices having more then 1024 px width.
Medium resolution layout will target the devices having width between 481px to 1023 px.
Low resolution layout will target the devices having width lass then 481px.

**High resolution wireframe**

When i was really satisfied with the wire frame i created, the next step was to make things little more alive in the photoshop.
Here are the snaps of the designs created in the photoshop.
