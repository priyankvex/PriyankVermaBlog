My 6th book of the year was a handpicked one "Outliers: The Story of Success". This book was actually recommended to me by my cousin as a "must read". And actually I was amazed how great this book is. It takes your intellectual thinking to a roller coaster ride.

As the book description says :


<blockquote>In this stunning new book, Malcolm Gladwell takes us on an intellectual journey through the world of "outliers"--the best and the brightest, the most famous and the most successful. He asks the question: what makes high-achievers different?</blockquote>


All the time we keep hearing success stories. We tend to see these successful guys as "lucky ones" or "smart one" or sometimes even as "self-made millionaire".

This book will change your perception for success. It unlocks various not so obvious, highly backed with facts factors that actually make success happen.

When you were born to what you eat to what your ancestors used to do? It is pretty amazing how all of these can affect how successful you can become.

I highly recommend this book to everyone. A very good read.

Also as the 7th book of the year I have started reading "How I Braved Anu Aunty and Co-Founded A Million Dollar Company". It is also a fun book to read but not a serious reading.

Will post review when done.
