Hi there,

This time would like to share my new project ' A basic calculator built for the android platform.'

Creating android apps always seemed cool to me . Able to start	learning  to create one is even cooler.

This project uses simple things like XML layouts, Activities using java, Intents, OnclickListeners and some more basic concepts of java and android.

Below are the screenshots of the app running in both real android device and AVD.
