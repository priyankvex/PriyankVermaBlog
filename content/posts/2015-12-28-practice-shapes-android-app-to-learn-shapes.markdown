<blockquote>Only way to learn something is to learn it by yourself.</blockquote>


Recently I have been playing with Canvas in android and it has been fun! :D

As they say knowledge is knowing tomato is a fruit. Wisdom is not putting it in vegetable basket. And best way to persist new gained "wisdom" is to put it in use.

Practice Shapes is a fun app both for kids and grown-up kids (Yes. You!), to test their drawing skills. Though I know drawing on a mobile screen with your fingers is not your favorite thing, but still you will enjoy it! :D

Download the app from play store :

To create images for the app on which user draws, i used GIMP. These are just simple images with transparent background.
