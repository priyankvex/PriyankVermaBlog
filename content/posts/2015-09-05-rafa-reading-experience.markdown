Here it is. 4th book of the year _**Rafa by Rafael Nadal and John Carlin.**_

Being arguably the biggest Rafa fan on this planet this book was in my reading bucket list from a long time. Finally got the opportunity to read this.

This is great in both sense, it gives you a more closer look into the life of your idol and at the same time shows you what does it take to be a champion? What does it take to be the best in the world at your sport? Rafael Nadal has the answers.

Book being the auto-biography tells how a small kid from Spain transformed himself into one of the world's greatest.

Reading this book you feel like you are inside Nadal's mind. You feel connected to him. You can feel his nerves while he discusses those crucial grand slam matches specially **_The Wimbeldon. _**You realize that the great Nadal is still a human yet what makes him very different is his grit, endurance and will to strive.

Nadal mentions many time the importance on endurance. That is what he was taught by Uncle Toni right from very young age.

My most favorite quote by Rafa is when he says "If you flag once, you will flag again."  If you go easy on your dream once, you will 100% do that again. One morning you want to miss morning training because you were on a night out last night, you do it once you do ti again.

This book will really leave impression on your mind. If you want to be anomaly you must behave like one.

The day I am finished this book, Nadal lost to Fognini in US Open 2015 3rd round. Being 2 set up he lost for the first time in his career. What a devastating loss? But I am sure Nadal being nadal will come back.

_**Vamos Rafa!**_

Next book I started is _**Outliers : Story of success. **_Which will be 5th book for the 10 book challenge. An awesome read on what sets a successful person a part.
