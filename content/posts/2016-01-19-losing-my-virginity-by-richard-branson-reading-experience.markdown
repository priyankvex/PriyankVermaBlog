<blockquote>**Oh, screw it, let's do it.**</blockquote>


That's the philosophy of Richard Branson that has allowed him to start ventures in markets that no one dared to enter and even considered ludicrous to try.

Losing my virginity is the most unusual biography you will ever get to read. It looks like you are reading a biography of not a global entrepreneur but an adventurist.

This is the story of how Richard Branson started his entrepreneur journey by starting the Student magazine and strolled his way to opening more than 400 companies under the Virgin brand.

The book starts with him in a hot air balloon and soon dives into his early life and childhood days. How his sporting career came to an end, which planted the seeds of an entrepreneur in him.

Soon you will find him writing about opening Virgin Music and not very late Virgin Megastores. His fight with British Airways for Virgin Atlantic and how his airline prevails and continues to thrive.

Richard Branson shows a so much fun way living his life. You can find him crash landing his balloon in desert to buying islands to signing _The Rolling Stones_ for his record label.

Later on his life he started businesses which looked altruistic to some, but for him was a great sustainable business model. For example Virgin Fuels and Virgin Unite.

Losing My Virginity is the ultimate tale of personal and business survival from a man who combines the business prowess of Bill Gates and the promotional instincts of P. T. Barnum.

This year I have challenged myself to read 15 books. This is my first of 2016. Next book I have picked is _Contagious : How Things Catch on. _Will blog about it too when done.
