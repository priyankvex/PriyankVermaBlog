Recently I was learning about Canvas and Custom views in Android and to put the theory in practice I made a pretty simple _**Paint App. **_

Source code of the app can be found [https://github.com/priyankvex/Paint-App-Android](https://github.com/priyankvex/Paint-App-Android).

The App is pretty simple with features
1.  Create Drawings (Obvious one :P).
2.  Select different brush sizes.
3.  Eraser with different sizes.
4.  Color pallet.
5.  Save drawings in Gallery.

Brownie points if you can guess the character I drew! :D
